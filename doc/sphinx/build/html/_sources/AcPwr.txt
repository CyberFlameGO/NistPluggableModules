AcPwrBaseClass
==============

All other AcPwr classes inherit from the AcPwrBase class.  Multiple phases (channels of loads) are defined all sharing a common Frequency and Frequency Range.  Each Phase has a Handle which uniquely identifies the hardware supporting that phase.

|image0|

Figure \: AcPwrBaseClass UML specification

Properties
----------
Frequency \: double
 The frequency setpoint for all phases.
 
FrequencyRange \: [double] 
 An array of frequencies that limit the upper and lower allowable frequencies, if the array has only one element, then that will be the upper allowable frequency with the lower being 0.  If the array has two elements, then the first element is the lower allowable frequency and the second element is the upper.


Phases \: [struct]
 An array of structures containing the properties of each phase or channel.  

	Handle \: string
	  A unique identifier of the hardware supporting the phase.
	  
	Connected \: bool
	  Used by the system and not end-user settable.  Indicates that the phase has been initialized and is tready to receive further commands.  Closing a phase disconnects the phase and resets Connected.
  
	Name \: string
	 The name of the phase.  In some cases this is for the conveinience of the end user, in other cases, the hardware may need bot a phase Handle and a Name. 
	 
	Enabled \: bool
	  Set by the end user to determine if the phase should be enabled (energized) or disabled (de-energized).
	 
	VoltageLevel \: double
	 Specifies the line-to-neutral voltave level when operating in constant voltage mode.  May also specify a voltage offseyt for an AC voltage
	 
	VoltageRange \: [double]
	   Array of voltages specifying the minimum and maximum allowable voltage levels.  If the array has only one element, then it is the maximum allowable level with the minimum being 0.  If therer are two elements then the first element is the minimum level and the second is the upper limit.
	   
	CurrentLimit \: double
	  Specifies the output current limit.  For the ChromaAcLoadClass this will be *IrmsMax* 
	  
	Waveform \: string
	  The name of the waveform to be generated if the phase is capable of generating waveform functions.	
	  
FunctionClass \: class
  If the phase is capable of generating waveform functions (either standard or arbitrary) this property holds the class reference of the function that creates the waveforms
    
FunctionIniFilePath \: path
  The path to the .ini file holding the properties the waveform function

            	
Methods
---------------

Initialize(reset\:bool, QueryID\:bool)
  Opens a connection to all phases.  Optionally reset the phase or check that the phase ID is valid.
  
ConfigPhases()
  Configure all phases with their property values
  
ConfigFrequency()
  Configure the frequency of all phases to the single frequency property value.
  
Disable()
   Cause all phases to apply the minimum amount of power possible. Instruments have various ways of perfroming the disable but typically do this by opening a realy on the channel that disconnects the generation/acquisitoin circuitry from the external pheonmena.  The software connection to the device remains connected after the input/output is disabled.
   
ResetCurrentProtection()
   If the phases have tripped on over current, this method resets the overcurrent protection if the user has manually reset the Enabled property to true.  Note that during a protection event, the enabled property must be automatically cleared.
   
ResetVoltageProtection()
   If the phases have tripped on over or under voltage, this method resets the protection and re-enables the phases if the user has manually reset the Enabled property to true.  Note that during a protection event, the enabled property must be automatically cleared.
   
Reset()
    Disable all phases and return all properties to default values.
	
Close()
    Closes the software connection to the devce and resets the device.

The Chroma AC load support one phase per device so multiple devises must be used to create multiple phases. One Module can support up to three devices 
so with a single module all three phases can be emulated. The IVI AC Power specification does not (yet) peovide an extension group for AC Loads but it seems to make sense to extend it.  Eventually this child class may become a base class for generic AC loads.

AcPwr Plugins
***************

The classes (ChromaAcLoad, NHRDCPower, NHRGridSim, and PacificPowerSource) listed below inherit all the modules and properties from the AcPwr Base Class. 

ChromaAcLoad.lvclass
====================

The following section lists every operation mode the AC/DC Chroma Power Load 638xx is capable of. Each mode utilizes a different set of parameters from the rest. If a variable is listed under an operation mode, it must be configured in order for the chroma to operate. If a variable is not listed under an operation mode, its value will be ignored when configuring the device. **Failing to configure a variable properly will potentially cause the Chroma to fail without sending an error message**. 

General Variables
-----------------

*The following variables are used by every operation mode*

	- AC/DC: Whether the device operates in AC or DC. When set to *true*, the device operates in DC mode. When set to *false*, the device operates in AC mode.
		AC Modes: CC, CP, CR, RLC, RLC CP, and Inrush
		DC Modes: CV, CP, CC, CR, and Rectified Mode
		
	- Mode: The operation modes of the device. The user must be careful to select an appropriate current type or the device will fail to configure.
		- CC: Constant Current. AC/DC
		- CP: Constant Power. AC/DC
		- CR: Constant Resistance. AC/DC
		- CV: Constant Voltage. DC only
		- RLC: RLC Circuit Simulation. AC only
		- RLC CP: RLC circuit with constant RMS Power. AC only
		- Inrush: Measures the inrush of an RLC circuit. AC only
		- Rectified: DC rectified mode. Converts a DC signal into an AC one. DC only
		
	- Load Short Circuited: When set to true, the load short circuits itself at its input. When set to false, the load operates normally. By default, this mode should be set to *false*.

Inrush
------

**Note**: Measuring the inrush current of the device is tricky, seeing as the mode quickly turns off. In order to perform measurements on this device, the user is recommended to use the *Set Peak Current Meas Hold* vi with the input set to *true*, then using the *Measure or Fetch Peak Current* vi.

*To Be Added to Inrush*
	- Phase: **Warning** This cannot currently be set; the module defaults to a phase of 0. In order to be able to set this, please modify the BaseConfig or Loads controls to include a *Phase* variable, then modify the *ConfigDevice* vi. When modifying the vi, look over to the 'Inrush" case of the SSM, expand the *Unbundle by Name*, select the newly created phase, and then wire it to the input of the *Set Phase of AC Inrush* vi, replacing the constant of 0.

Recommended Improvements
------------------------
-The project currently has a "load short circuited variable" that is not wired up to anything. There's a VI that can use this variable, but it seemed more appropriate to attach this VI to a separate call, rather than the "Config device" call.

This is the only way the main module has to access its class properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

	|Set? (F)     | This terminal determines whether the module saves the properties of the *Class In* terminal to the class or not. By default (false), the properties are not saved; this terminal must be set to true in order for a save to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

	|State In     | Wiring a string variable into this terminal allows the user to control the state of the module's measurement. The string *must* match one of the measurement statuses described in the *Measurements SSM*, otherwise the module will default to the *Idle* state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

	|State Out    | Outputs a string with a value indicating the status of the module's measurements. The string *should* match one of the measurement statuses described in the *Measurements SSM*, and are sometimes used to control the logic flow of the module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

	|Set?         | This terminal determines whether the string input to the *State In* terminal is saved and used to control the state of the measurements loop. By default (false), the value is ignored; the value must be set for true in order for the input to be utilized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
